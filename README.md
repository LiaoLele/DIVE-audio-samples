- Determined situation  
This folder contains the (variational channels) mixture signals and their corresponding SOI estimates by different algorithms in the determined situation where the number of microphones is equivariant with the source number. 
- Under-determined situation
This folder contains the (2 channels) mixture signals and their corresponding SOI estimates by different algorithms in the under-determined situation where the number of microphones is fixed to be 2.
